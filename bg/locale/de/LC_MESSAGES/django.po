"<p class=\"instrheading\"> Exchange Process </p> <p class=\"instrpar\"> To "
"play this game, we form groups of three players. Each player is endowed with "
"1 euro that can be used to buy an asset. Your task during the game is thus "
"to choose whether you want to buy the asset. This asset does not generate "
"any dividend. If the asset price exceeds 1 euro, you can still buy the "
"asset. We indeed consider that a financial partner (who is not part of the "
"game) provides you with the additional capital and shares profits with you "
"according to the respective capital invested. The market proceeds "
"sequentially. The first player is offered the opportunity to buy at a price "
"P1. If he buys, he proposes to sell the asset to the second player at a "
"price that is 10 times higher, P2=10×P1. If the second player agrees to buy, "
"the first player ends up the game with 10 euros. The second player then "
"proposes to sell the asset to the third trader at a price P3=10×P2 =100×P1 . "
"If the third player buys the asset, the second player ends up the game with "
"10 euros. The third player does not find anyone to whom he can sell the "
"asset. Since this asset does not generate any dividend, he ends up the game "
"with 0 euros. This game is summarized in the following figure. </p>"
